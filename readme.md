# Advent of Code 2015
#### Implemented in Python

This is my first experience with Python (aside from some messing around many years ago),
so this is not exactly going to be the highest quality code I've ever
produced. I do hope it's starting to shape up by the end of the calendar.

I'm starting this very much late, at the end of 2020, fresh off the tails of AoC 2020 (which I 
implemented in Kotlin).
